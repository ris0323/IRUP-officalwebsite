      <h6>Farmers of Liyu community practices organic farming or eco-friendly farming (i.e. reduced use of agrochemicals) to protect farmland ecosystem from ongoing habitat loss and degradation, support biodiversity and enhance ecosystem health. On top of that, the organic (or eco-growing) rice can not only ensure responsible and sustainable production but also enhance human physical health than conventional farming.
        <br><br>
      Regarding the SEPLS management, farmers make use of excess water resources in rice paddy and then develop a transformative way to control rice blast disease, literally, turning a disadvantage to a useful mean. They also implement several practices that can benefit crop production and biodiversity conservation mutually, for examples, use of Azolla as a green manure in rice cultivation, no herbicide spray, and creation of ecological ponds as biological refuge during non-growing time (i.e., rice fields would be left dried). Crop fields are used for the purpose of environmental education, recreation and community events, which strengthen consensus among residents, enhance physical and mental health, as well as improve human wellbeing of community.
      <br><br>
      Moreover, with establishing a cross-sectoral platform, Liyu community promotes responsible production and consumption (e.g., Participatory Guarantee System) , develops green production chain, that can provide adequate economic drivers to pursue the SDGs.

      <h5 class="mb-4">Study Site</h5>
      <h6>
        The Liyu Community is located in Sanyi Township, Miaoli County, has a total area of 1,054 hectares, and an elevation ranging from 100 to 500 meters above sea level. Its hilly terrain has a diverse natural habitat and supports numerous terrestrial plants and animals. It is surrounded by mountains in the north, south, and east, and features well-protected secondary forests along its hillsides. The western side is an area with smooth terrain and a slope of less than 10%. Its soil is alluvial (i.e., made from Jingshan River’s alluvial deposits), fertile, rich in nutrients, and suitable for crop cultivation, especially rice.
        <br><br>
        The community is located below the Liyutan Reservoir that has an upstream catchment area of 53.5 square kilometers at the Liyu Lake. The reservoir was opened in 1992 and has a total storage capacity of 126 million cubic meters. It mainly supplies water to Miaoli County and Taichung City.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, it is used for irrigation, flood control, power generation, and serves as a sightseeing area. Aside from being used for the public water supply, the water released from the dam is also diverted for irrigation. The irrigated area is 4,147 hectares large, with rice being the main crop grown in the area. According to the Li-Yu-Tan Reservoir Management Center water quality monitoring data from 2004 to 2020, the reservoir water quality is Grade A, meaning that the water quality is good and sufficiently provides high-quality water for the farmlands in the Liyu Community.

      <h5 class="mb-4">Challenges</h5>
      <h6>
        Climate extremes (e.g., draught) and insufficient water resources may be common challenges that agriculture production is facing with globally. Unlike of that, Liyu community is blessed with natural resources, including clean water, stable irrigation supply, and fertile soil. It is located downstream of the Liyu reservoir surrounding by forests, secondary forests, and farmlands, which forms the SEPLS in the so-called “Low Elevation Mountain Ecosystem” of Taiwan (i.e., attitude lower below 800 m).
        <br><br>
        There is less human activity and industrial development, leading to lower probability of interference upon wildlife. Therefore, the Liyu community retains richer biodiversity. However, before 2013, most residents practiced conventional farming that is harmful to both human and environments. Since then, Residents began to realize the interlinkages among biodiversity, responsible production and human health and then have been practiced organic/eco-friendly farming (e.g., reduced use of agrochemicals) to protect farmland ecosystem from ongoing habitat loss and degradation. Besides that, the organic (or eco-growing) rice can not only ensure responsible and sustainable production but also enhance human physical health than conventional farming.
      </h6>

      <h5 class="mb-4">Actions and Approaches</h5>
      <h6>
        In recent years, governmental authorities of Taiwan (e.g., COA) actively promote the SDG goals and apply practical measures to rehabilitate farmland ecosystems. However, few systematic approaches have been well addressed. The purpose of this study is to provide scientific evidence of farming practices to enhance both human and ecosystem health in rural and demonstrate a local-scale implication for policy makers. In order to achieve the goal which can be a win-win situation for both human and the entire rural production landscapes, corresponding objectives are:
        <br><br>
        <ol>
          <li>To restore rural production landscapes with eco-friendly farming (Figure 2).</li>
          <li>To support biodiversity by implementing habitat restoration and eco-farming practices (Figure 3 & Figure 4).</li>
          <li>To integrate traditional farming wisdom and modern technology related to pest biocontrol and resilience (Figure 5 & Figure 6).</li>
          <li>To increase local incomes and economics by green production chain (Figure 7).</li>
        </ol>

      <h5 class="mb-4">Preliminary Results</h5>
      <h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Long-term ecological monitoring provides insight of the benefits for organic/eco-friendly farming practices on biodiversity conservation. Results indicate that organic/eco-farming rice fields support the higher species richness and abundance in various taxonomic groups (e.g., aquatic species). It also represents significant difference on species richness between paddy fields in eco-friendly farming and others in conventional practice.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Regarding the production landscape management, farmers make use of excess water resources in rice paddy and then develop a transformative way to control rice blast disease, literally, turning a disadvantage to a useful mean. Biological pest control experiment attempts to discover the mechanisms of natural resource management integrating traditional wisdom and culture, particularly, emphasis on controlling Golden Apple Snail (GAS) population which is threating the food production and local incomes. Results show that food waste and several natural fruits can serve as effective baits when setting up traps to control GAS spread during the early stage of crop growing seasons. Farmers also implement other practices that can benefit crop production and biodiversity mutually, such as using Azolla as a green manure in rice cultivation, no herbicide spray, and creation of ecological ponds as biological refuge during non-growing time (i.e., rice fields would be left dried). </li>
          <br>
          <li>Liyu community promotes responsible production and consumption (PGS), develops green production chain that provides economic drivers to pursue sustainability.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The systematic implementation demonstrates a practical, repeatable framework to government authorities, policy makers and other stake holders in terms of evaluating the integrity of ecosystem and its response to farming disturbance; then boosts the success of actions to conserve and restore biodiversity. With the final outcome, it can enhance health of both human and the farmland ecosystem.</li>
